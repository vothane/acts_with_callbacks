Acts_With_Callbacks
==========

This acts_with extension provides the capabilities for adding (before|after)_save and (before|after)_destroy callbacks to ActiveResource

Requirements & Dependencies
===========================

ruby            >= 1.9.2
active_resource >= 3.0.0
active_support  >= 3.0.0

Example
=======

class Story < ActiveResource::Base
	acts_with_callbacks
	
	self.site = "http://www.pivotaltracker.com/services/v3/projects/#{PIVOTAL_PROJECT_ID}"
	headers['X-TrackerToken'] = PIVOTAL_API_TOKEN

	after_save :saving_message1, :saving_message2
	before_destroy :destroy_message1, :destroy_message2
	
	private
	
	def saving_message1
		puts "saved"
	end

	def saving_message2
		put "saved again"
	end

	def destroy_message1
		puts "destroyed"
	end

	def destroy_message1
		puts "about to be destroyed"
	end

	def destroy_message2
		puts "about to be destroyed again"
	end
end

TODOs
=======

before and after cannot be used together for the same save or destroy method

example (will not work):

class Story < ActiveResource::Base
	acts_with_callbacks
	
	self.site = "http://www.pivotaltracker.com/services/v3/projects/#{PIVOTAL_PROJECT_ID}"
	headers['X-TrackerToken'] = PIVOTAL_API_TOKEN

	before_save :saving_message1
	after_save :saving_message2
	
	private 
	
	def saving_message1
		puts "saved"
	end

	def saving_message2
		put "saved again"
	end
end
